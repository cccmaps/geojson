The food storage pits and houses were full, and the busy harvest season was over. Food and feasting was a central element in Matariki, and people came together to share the fruits of the harvest. Other forms of celebration included music, dance, art and spending time with one another. Gather your whanau together, eat some tasty kai and have a celebration together.",
