Built with a conical shaped pedestal clad with Halswell bluestone, the dial plate is made from polished ebony granite and the dial of brass. The darker colouring and natural materials were felt to be more harmonious than previous materials used for garden ornamentation. During the 1950s there were multiple issues with the ornamental mirror pool in the centre of the Rosary and it was decided that a sundial would be a more suitable feature. Christchurch resident Thomas Stevenson donated eighty pounds towards the creation of a sundial and it was constructed in 1954. A brass plate is attached to the base of the sundial bearing the inscription: Erected to the memory of the late Thomas Stevenson of Papanui, Christchurch, September 23rd 1954.",

Initially, the gallery was home to a small collection of 160 paintings and sculptures but this collection steadily grew. With the development of a new Christchurch Art Gallery on Montreal Street in 2003, the Robert McDougall Art Gallery was closed but used periodically for Canterbury Museum exhibitions until it sustained damage in the 2010 earthquakes. It is currently undergoing repairs. The Robert McDougall Art Gallery is a Category 1 listed building.  The sculptures outside the doors make up Paul Dibble’s E Noho Ra De Chirico which means ‘Goodbye De Chirico’ in Māori. The artwork is a nod to Georgio de Chirico, an Italian modernist who would paint classical scenes but with unexpected elements thus giving them a mysterious and ethereal quality. In Dibble’s work the torso is taken from a de Chirico work and the leaf is an abstract addition, suggestive of the fall of modernism.",

Commissioned and constructed in 1992, Manuel and Woods bring diverse cultures together through a shared respect for water and its significance as life bringer and place of pilgrimage in both Māori and European history. Manuel’s sculpture, Kaitiaki Kiwa, (to the right of the spring) embodies the shape of a Māori Water Spirit, which you can see in the curves of the natural shape of the rock. Woods’ sculpture (left of the spring and pictured below) utilises the triskele, an ancient symbol first appearing in 3000BCE, to represent Celtic and Māori heritage, celebrating the circle and unity of life in both cultures. Te Puna Ora was blessed by Tip Manihea, a highly respected kaumātua (Māori elder) from the Tūhoe iwi (tribe).",
