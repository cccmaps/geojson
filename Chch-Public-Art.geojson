Puari was the name of an early Waitaha settlement which stretched from the banks of ÅŒtÄkaro Avon River at Victoria Square out to Bealey Avenue in the years between 1000 and 1500. The loop in the river that encompassed the site was an important mahinga kai (food gathering area). While little is known about this settlement or its occupants, many taonga (treasured possessions) have been found in this region. At its height the pÄ would have been home to about 800 Waitaha people."

There were claims that metal used for the artwork came from guns seized at Sebastopol during the Crimean war (1854-56). Before travelling to New Zealand the statue was exhibited at South Kensington Museum in London where contemporary critics were impressed by Woolner's portrayal of Godley. Woolner was a leading sculptor of the time and part of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a movement advocating for a return to the realistic depiction of nature."

There were nine replicas of the statue, however, the Christchurch work has unique pedestal reliefs.  A few days after the statue was installed the cry of a cat was heard emanating inside. Before the being erected, the statue had laid on the ground where the cat had made its home. So Queen Victoria had to be hoisted off her pedestal while the cat was lured out. "

The Lyttelton Times noted, â€œThe statue itself is a very good likeness. This was shown by the remarks made as soon as it was unveiled, many of those present saying that the likeness could not have been bettered.â€  William Rolleston was prominently involved in the politics and administration of the Canterbury province. His most distinguished public position was that of the fourth and last superintendent of Canterbury. The location of the statue on Rolleston Avenue between the Canterbury Museum and the original University buildings, now the Arts Centre is significant as Rolleston was the leading political impetus behind both these provincial institutions."

        "year": 1917,
        "long-description": "Christchurch was the New Zealand base for British Antarctic expeditions led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott in 1901 and in 1910, with the South Pole reached on January 25, 1912. On the return journey a planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, although Scott had ordered his team to do so, and at a distance of 150 miles from their base camp and 11 miles from the next depot, Scott and his companions perished from a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold. Scott wrote â€œWe took risks, we knew we took them; things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for complaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our best to the last ... Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman. These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the taleâ€¦.â€ News of the death of Scott and his companions did not reach Christchurch until February 11, 1913.  A week after the news broke a committee was set up to organise a Scott memorial. Council entered into a contract with Lady Kathleen Scott (later Lady Kennet), a sculptor married to Captain Scott since 1908. A bronze statue was originally intended but when work began in 1915 all available metal was being used by armament makers with scarcity of material pushing the price up. Carrara marble became the viable alternative.  Scott portrayed her late husband in polar dress, facing north on the homeward journey. On the plinth the names of the expedition crew are inscribed along with an extract from Captain Scottâ€™s last note as he awaited death.  To avoid damage to the raised hand and leg of the sculpture, it was transported to New Zealand incomplete. Negotiations faltered over increased costs of completing the statue in marble, and Lady Scott did not travel to Christchurch before her death in 1947 so the statue remains unfinished."

The two components of the sculpture were placed on either side of the entry to the Gallery. Plinths had been constructed on the sides of the entry to the Robert McDougall when it was built in 1932 and the Dibble sculptures were the first to make use of this design feature. Dibble’s intention for the work was to take the classical form of the European torso and to relocate it in a Pacific vernacular. Classical form is further alluded to in the title, E Noho Ra De Chirico which pays homage to De Chirico, a modernist who often placed classical elements within the modernist environment of his art. "

The sculptor Francis Shurrock was a leading interwar New Zealand sculptor.  The Bronze statue is on a stone plinth on a concrete base.  A terrazo plaque is inscripted on the front of the plinth.

        "long-description": "\"When Richard Green approached the Council about erecting a statue in Fitzgerald’s memory, initial response was favourable. Francis Shurrock a master of sculpture at the Canterbury School of Arts was commissioned to produce a sculpture for a site in Latimer Square. Problems soon surfaced with the relatives of Green. Green’s descendants instigated court proceedings, claiming that Green was neglecting the maintenance of his family. Claims were laid that Green was attempting to dispose of his money through the costs of the Fitzgerald statue. The Council received many strongly worded letters from Green’s relatives petitioning them to decline the statue. The Council’s response was to withdraw its acceptance until an outcome was reached with the court case. Under the instruction of Green, Shurrock had continued to work on the statue, finished the modelling and had it cast in England. However, when the statue arrived back in New Zealand, the dispute was no nearer conclusion so the statue sat in the customs yard for two years. Finally after prolonged negotiations it was agreed that the Domains Board would accept the Fitzgerald statue. In a brief ceremony the statue was unveiled on 3 February, 1939. Still the controversy over the Fitzgerald statue continued. The site that was chosen for the statue did not account for the modifications Shurrock had made for it to be viewed in the open space of Latimer Square. Instead the statue received a canopy of foliage. Further debate was aroused over the quality of stone that was used for the plinth. After the saga of the Fitzgerald statue the Christchurch City Council were wary of repeating the performance and it was some years before another public commission was undertaken.  \""
